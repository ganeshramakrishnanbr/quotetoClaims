## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a senior executive, I want to access a visually compelling dashboard that provides real-time insights into our Claims to Quotes system performance, so I can quickly understand business metrics, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions without needing to dive into detailed reports.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an executive is logged into the system, **When** they access the dashboard, **Then** they should see a visually appealing interface with key performance indicators prominently displayed.
2. **Given** an executive is viewing the dashboard, **When** they interact with data visualization elements, **Then** the visualizations should respond with smooth animations and updated information.
3. **Given** an executive is exploring performance metrics, **When** they filter or drill down into specific data points, **Then** the dashboard should update dynamically to show the relevant filtered information.
4. **Given** an executive is presenting to other stakeholders, **When** they navigate between different dashboard sections, **Then** transitions should be smooth and professional looking.
5. **Given** an executive wants to understand product performance, **When** they view the product mix visualization, **Then** they should see a clear breakdown of business by product type.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there is no data available for a specific visualization? System should display an elegant "No data available" message with visual consistency.
- How does the system handle performance degradation? Dashboard should prioritize visual elements over background data processing to maintain responsive UI.
- What if an executive accesses the dashboard on a device with a smaller screen? Dashboard should adapt responsively while maintaining visual hierarchy and data integrity.
